package Example.Violator is

	function Get_Int return Integer; --This gets Int, even though it's private. This works because contrary to how you think of "private", it doesn't mean that in Ada. As long as it's not an Ada Standard Library package (because they are aware of this but decided a bandaid fix was fine), you can create a child package like this, and still get at "private" values.
